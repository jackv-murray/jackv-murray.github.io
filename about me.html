										<h1>About me</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Hey! I'm Jack, and I work as a data analyst but have a background in microbiology. I started acquiring an interest in data and programming
										as a student, when I realised the importance that it plays in informing many aspects of research. I found it fascinating how people such as bioinformaticians
										process and organise biological data using programming, and the impact that they have had in the world of genetics. After a few years working in laboratories, I decided that I wanted
										to focus more on developing data skills and in 2022 I took the plunge and managed to successfully break into the industry as an analyst at Tesco after self-learning SQL and python. 
										<b> </b>
									At Tesco I had the opportunity to further develop my SQL skills, specifically in SQL Server. I also picked up Tableau, a BI tool which I shortly became certified in and discovered that I have a penchant for
										building dashboards. In 2023 I joined People's Postcode Lottery (PPL), again as an analyst, searching for further opportunities to continue my career development. At PPL I've continued to develop
										both my SQL and python skills by exploring my interests in data engineering, working on automation and pursuing data engineering topics, alongside self-directed studying.  
										<b></b>
										My long-term aspiration is to be a data engineer and I am totally committed to the journey! </p>
								<strong>Other interests</strong>
                                <p>I have a real passion for music - I love playing the guitar and going to gigs! I have a very varied taste in music and love
									discovering something new to listen to. My main guitar is a left-handed Schecter Hellraiser - it's a beauty of an instrument. Other than that, I enjoy playing table tennis,
									reading (usually about music) and video games.
									</p> <strong>Website</strong>
								<p> The website was built using HTML, with the backbone taken from html5up, and all modifications were done in visual studio code. The logo on the homepage was made using VectorStock images and PowerPoint.
